# Resolving `.gitignore` Not Updating After Merging Feature Branch into `master`

## üß© Problem Summary

After merging a feature branch (`feature/add-elementary`) into `master`, untracked files like `dbt.log`, `elementary_output.json`, and others continued to appear when switching to `master`. This was unexpected because `.gitignore` had been updated in the feature branch to ignore these files.

However, after the merge:
- The `.gitignore` file in `master` did **not match** the one from the feature branch.
- Untracked/ignored files continued to show in `master`.
- GitHub displayed ‚ÄúThis branch is 2 commits behind `master`‚Äù, adding confusion.

---

## üîç Root Cause

1. The `.gitignore` file was modified in the feature branch but:
   - It may not have been properly committed.
   - Or it was silently **overwritten or skipped** during the merge into `master`.

2. Git does **not automatically delete or hide existing local files**, even if they are listed in `.gitignore`.

3. The local `master` branch was **out of sync** with `origin/master`, blocking pushes due to a fast-forward conflict.

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution Steps

### 1. Ensure changes from feature branch are applied to `.gitignore` in `master`
```bash
# Switch to master branch
git checkout master

# Pull in .gitignore from the feature branch
git checkout feature/add-elementary -- .gitignore

# Confirm the change is staged
git status

# Commit the update
git commit -m "Update .gitignore to match feature/add-elementary"
````

### 2. Resolve remote update conflict by pulling with rebase

```bash
# Rebase local changes on top of origin/master
git pull --rebase origin master
```

### 3. Push the updated `master` branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin master
```

## üí° Notes and Best Practices

* Always **check if `.gitignore` changes were committed** before merging branches.
* Use `git diff` or `git log -- .gitignore` to confirm if it‚Äôs in the history.
* `.gitignore` only prevents new files from being tracked ‚Äî it does **not remove existing untracked files**.
* To clean up local untracked (ignored) files:

  ```bash
  git clean -fdX  # ONLY removes ignored files
  ```
* Use `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` to avoid unnecessary merge commits in linear workflows.

---

## ‚úÖ Final State

* `.gitignore` in `master` matches the feature branch.
* Untracked files listed in `.gitignore` are properly ignored.
* `master` is up-to-date with origin and clean.
