# üîß Fixing a Bug in Master While Working on a Feature Branch (With Local Changes)

Here‚Äôs the **right approach** to fix a bug in the `master` branch **without losing or mixing up** your current work in `feature/elementary-config`, which contains **uncommitted and untracked changes**.

---

### üß† Situation:

* You‚Äôre working on `feature/elementary-config` with **local uncommitted + untracked changes** ‚úÖ
* You need to **quickly fix a bug in `master`** and push it as a new branch ‚úÖ
* After that, you want to come back and **continue work on your feature branch** ‚úÖ

---

### ‚úÖ **Steps to Follow (Clean and Professional)**

Assuming you‚Äôre on `feature/elementary-config`:

---

#### 1. **Stash all current work, including new (untracked) files:**

```bash
git stash push --include-untracked -m "WIP on elementary-config"
```

---

#### 2. **Fetch latest changes and update your local `master`:**

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

---

#### 3. **Create a new branch from `master` to fix the bug:**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/excel-fix
```

---

#### 4. **Fix the bug, then commit your changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix uc_ra_global_rmp_fr_timelines column line break"
```

---

#### 5. **Push the bugfix branch and create a pull request:**

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin feature/excel-fix
```

> üéØ Now open a pull request to merge `feature/excel-fix` into `master`.

---

### ‚úÖ After the Bugfix is Merged into Master

---

#### 6. **Update your local `master` again:**

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

---

#### 7. **Switch back to your feature branch:**

```bash
git checkout feature/elementary-config
```

---

#### 8. **Rebase your feature branch on top of the updated `master`:**

```bash
git rebase master
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If conflicts occur:

```bash
git add <resolved-file>
git rebase --continue
```

> ‚ùå To cancel the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

#### 9. **Apply your previously stashed changes:**

```bash
git stash pop
```

> üõ†Ô∏è Resolve any conflicts, stage, and commit if needed.

---

#### 10. **Continue working or push your updated feature branch:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Continue work on feature/elementary-config"
git push --force-with-lease
```

> Use `--force-with-lease` only if you previously rebased and already pushed the branch.

---

### ‚úÖ Git Commands Summary (Copy-Paste Version):

```bash
# Save current feature work
git stash push --include-untracked -m "WIP on elementary-config"

# Create and push bugfix branch
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/excel-fix
git add .
git commit -m "Fix uc_ra_global_rmp_fr_timelines column line break"
git push --set-upstream origin feature/excel-fix

# After merging bugfix PR
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout feature/elementary-config
git rebase master
git stash pop
git add .
git commit -m "Continue work on feature/elementary-config"
git push --force-with-lease
```

---

### üí° Why This Is Best Practice

* Keeps bugfix **isolated and easy to review**
* Avoids mixing half-done work with urgent hotfixes
* Maintains a **clean, linear history**
* Safeguards your local changes with `stash`
